In the Journées Françaises d'Informatique Graphique of 2022 held in Bordeaux, France, I presented a part of my work about Terrain erosion. The goal of this conference as students is to share current progress in different fields, get feedbacks from experts and other students, and more immportantly, learn to speak with a large public. The work presented is seldom published.
