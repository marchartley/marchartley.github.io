# About me
I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Montpellier, focusing on procedural terrain generation for underwater environments since 2021. My research revolves around creating 3D environments by abstracting terrain representations. In the literature, many representations can be used (height fields, voxel grids, implicit surfaces, ...). My goal is to develop algorithms that are easy to implement, adaptable across all different representations, and straightforward for users to grasp and apply.

I prioritize predictability to ensure the generated results are interpretable and aligned with user preferences. My approach emphasizes user-in-the-loop procedural generation, where user input drives the algorithm's decisions, moving away from purely automated processes.

My fields of interest are mainly focused around:
* Procedural modeling
* Terrain generation
* Texture generation
* Particle systems
* Animal behaviour
* Creative coding
