I gave ~25h of teaching on the use of Raspberry Pi, for which I hijacked the signal processing aspect to turn it into image and video processing:

- [Introduction to video processing](/files/Teachings/Image%20Interaction/Image_et_Interaction___Background_substraction.pdf)
- [Use of ArUco](/files/Teachings/Image%20Interaction/Image_et_Interaction___Detection%20(1).pdf)
- [Introduction to Deep Learning for image processing](/files/Teachings/Image%20Interaction/Image_et_Interaction___AI.pdf)
    - I proposed a small Python package for object detection and pose estimation for OpenCV: [Github link](https://github.com/marchartley/PoseEstimation)

    - I proposed another Python package for graphics with OpenCV: [Github link](https://github.com/marchartley/OpenCVGraphics)
